## Description:

Greetings!

This **Travel Agency Page** is an HTML workshop offered by freeCodeCamp. 

The purpose of this HTML project is to learn and better understand HTML by creating a travel agency webpage showcasing possible activities and the adventures tourists may enjoy in the exotic destination of Costa Rica. 

After completing this project, I was able to construct my own travel agency webpage application by utilizing the most common HTML tags.
